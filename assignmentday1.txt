Machine Learning is not just a technology, it's us. The different types of Machine Learning can be considered as different stages of our learning in our lives. When we were born we didn't know to do anything, so our parents taught us to do small things, but important things like walking. Our parents hold us and make us keep small steps, helps us to keep our balance(similarly programmers train in the Supervised ML). Once we get used to it and learn it. We will start on ourselves and we may fall many times but each time we improve and at last, we learn to walk properly. Then comes the toddler stage, where we start to see things and try to imitate it(this can be considered as unsupervised learning). A toddler can easily identify the people who they see usually(ML trains with large datasets). Then comes the teenage stage, where we mistakes but we learn from it(Reinforcement Learning). So Machine Learning is basically like ourselves and it's getting closer to us day by day. They are present as analysts, doctors, salesmen, even friends (Alexa you there?).
